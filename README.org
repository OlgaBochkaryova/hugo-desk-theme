#+TITLE: Hugo 'Desk' theme

The theme is made from scratch with [[https://gohugo.io][Hugo]], and uses SVG icons by [[https://svgrepo.com][svgrepo]], with
the aim to have a simple, (hopefully) JS-free, but nice theme.

In case you have noticed a typo, or have any other suggestion or comment ---
please open an issue here in the repo, or [[https://www.bochkarev.io/contact][contact]] me in any other
convenient way.
